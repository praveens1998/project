First published by McClelland and Stewart in 1995, it won the 1995 Giller Prize.[3] It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1996. It was one of the only two Canadian books selected for Oprah's Book Club, and was one of the selected books in the 2002 edition of Canada Reads, championed by actress Megan Follows.
