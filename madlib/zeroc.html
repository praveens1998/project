<h3>
Fiction. South Asia Studies. Translated from the Tamil by Pritham K. Chakravarthy and Rakesh Khanna. With its mad patchwork of phone sex conversations, nightmarish torture scenes, tender love poems, numerology, mythology, and compulsive name-dropping of Latin American intellectuals, Charu Nivedita's novel ZERO DEGREE stands out as a groundbreaking work of Tamil transgressive fiction that unflinchingly probes the deepest psychic wounds of humanity. "Hide it in the deep recesses of your clothes cupboard or in the general chaos of your office desk, if you must, but read it"--Asha S. Menon, New Sunday Express</h3>
