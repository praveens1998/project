Batman: The Killing Joke is a 2016 American animated superhero film produced by Warner Bros. Animation and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the twenty-sixth film in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland. The film is directed by Sam Liu, written by Brian Azzarello and stars the voices of Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Tara Strong, and Ray Wise. It is the first Batman animated film to be rated R by the MPAA.

The film premiered at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2016. Originally intended to be released directly on home video, due to its popularity, the film was instead released simultaneously in theaters and digitally on July 25, 2016 for a special one-night event, before a DVD and Blu-ray release on August 2, 2016. It grossed $4.4 million worldwide.[3] The film's critical reception ranges from mixed to negative. It received criticism for its 30-minute original prologue and its portrayal of Batgirl, while the adaptation of the source material was met with more mixed results. However, Hamill's and Conroy's performances as the Joker and Batman, respectively, received praise.
